### 2022-01-24
- Fix broken `require`, `global` and potentially even `remote`, cause by an incomplete performance improvement. Sorry, my bad
- Add support for `sumneko.lua` `< 2.6.0`, since I broke the plugin pre `2.6.0`

### 2021-06-18
- Add Event Handler Parameter Annotating. See readme for explanation and exact behavior, though the latter may not be the most useful
